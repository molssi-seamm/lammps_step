History

2025.2.7 -- Installation issue
   * Encountered problems with the OpenMPI version of LAMMPS and with the installation
     of OpenKIM, so fixed the CONDA environment file to correct.
   * Changed logging at the INFO level to DEBUG to reduce the output when using geomeTRIC.

2024.8.22 -- Bugfix: error in number of cores.
   * Fixed an error if options for number of cores were strings, not numbers.
     
2024.7.31 -- Bugfix and improvements for parallel runs
   * There was an issue saving the pressure and volume as properties due to a mismatch
     in the names used. This has been corrected.
   * Improved how the code determines the number of processors to use for parallel runs,
     giving salience to the number of atoms in the system, but limiting to the LAMMPS and
     global limits on numbers of cores as well as the hardware available.
     
2024.7.25 -- Bugfix and improvements
   * Bugfix: Fixed issue with the initial seamm.ini file, created if it is missing from
     the installation.
   * Added the ability to set the number of points in the trajectories rather than the
     sampling rate.
   * Added diagnositic information and timings to available results.
     
2024.7.21.1 -- Minor internal change for GUI
   * Switched to new functionality in the SEAMM widgets to simplify the layout of the
     trajectories panel.
     
2024.7.21 -- Improved handling of trajectories and results
   * Improved control over the trajectories of positions, velocities, etc. to allow the
     user to give the number of points in the trajectory rather than the time interval
     of samples
   * Added volume of the cell to properties, and the cell lengths, density, and volume
     for NVE and NVT, where those parameters don't vary but are nonetheless useful in
     subsequent analysis.
     
2024.6.28.1 -- Internal release to fix issue making Docker image.

2024.6.28 -- Added energy and forces to properties
   * Added ability to get the energy and forces from single point calculations to supprt
     e.g. energy scans.
   * Fixed issue with assigning atoms types if they have not been assigned but are None
   * Updated for change in the order of units in the new version of pint
   * Improved analsys based on the output file.
     
2024.3.22 -- Corrected issue with e.g. heat flux calculations
   * Corrected an issue running LAMMPS via Python, introduced in the new scheme for
     executing. It ignored parallelism.
     
2024.3.21 -- Switched to new installation scheme
   * Fully support ~/SEAMM/lammps.ini
   * Updated to new installer
   * Support for Conda and Docker installation.
     
2024.1.18 -- Restructured to support running in containers.

2023.11.7 -- Bugfix: properties that are constant
   * A property, such as the total energy, can be a constant over an MD run due to
     precision of the trajectory. This caused errors because the autocorrelation
     function is not defined. These cases are now detected and the ACF not calculated
     for them.
     
2023.11.6 -- Bugfix in thermal conductivity
   * Due to change in input file name.

2023.9.6 -- Corrected issues with final coordinates; added velocities
   * There was a problem with getting the final coordinates from a dump file. 
   * Added saving and reusing velocities so now a second LAMMPS step will by default use
     the velocities from the previous step, which is what you would expect.

2023.8.31 -- Bugfix: not reading structure correctly after dynamics

2023.8.27 -- Added support for tabulated angle potentials.
   * Support for the CL&P-OPLSAA potential for octahedral PF6-
     
2023.8.21 -- Bugfix: x-axes length on graphics incorrect
   * The size of the x-axes of the trajectory graphs were wrong, often much too large,
     compressing the actual data near the beginning of the graph.
   * Fixed an issue with systems with no non-bonds.

2023.6.17 -- Bugfix: more centroid/stress/atom issues
   * Avoided using centroid/stress/atom for heat flux in standard NVE, NVT, ... dynamics
     with Class 2 forcefield.
   * Added option to not use centroid/stress/atom for any forcefield.
2023.6.16 -- Heat flux with PCFF
   * centroid/stress/atom does not work with Class 2 forcefields, so don't use for PCFF.
2023.5.29 -- Self diffusion and other improvements
   * Added trajectory panel to support diffusion, viscosity and simple thermal
     conductivity.
   * Added support for separate GPU versions of LAMMPS.
   * Added support for command-line arguments to LAMMPS, mainly used for accelerators.
   * Added support for using modules.

2023.4.24 -- Support for thermal conductivity
   * Internal changes to support thermal conductivity with its embedded flowchart.
   * Added the heat flux substep.
   * Now delete output and reference files when rerunning, so the output is clean.
   * Internal changes to support running LAMMPS from a Python driver.
   * Corrected units of properties returned from LAMMPS when e.g. metal units used.
   * Added support for Buckingham potentials
   * Fixed issues with and cleaned up the use of hybrid types for bonds, angles, ....
   * Fixed issues with the alignment of some of the widgets in the GUI.
     
2023.4.9 -- Hid the warning from pymbar
   * Importing pymbar timeseries writes a warning to the terminal about its proper
     usage. SEAMM already handles the warned case, so the message is simply confusing to
     users and hence this release hides it.
     
2023.4.6 -- Better forcefield handling.
   * Added correct molecule numbers for valence forcefields.
   * Correctly handle ReaxFF from OpenKim
   * Updated for some minor changes in OpenKim

2022.10.31 -- Bugfix: properties with commas

  protect the property name!

2022.10.27 -- Added properties
  * Added properties to be saved in the database.
  * Updated calls to `pymbar` because the names of methods were changed.
